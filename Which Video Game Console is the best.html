	<h1>What video game console is the best</hi>
<h3>Hello there, your probaly came onto this website looking for a answer. You probaly want a video game console or are looking at which one to get. My name is Jaiden, and here is an honest review on video game consoles.</h3>
<p>First, we have to rule what a gaming console is, and what it's functions are. A console is a computer designed for video games by connecting a screen and battery to it's ports. By doing so, you run the functions the console does and !SURPRISE!, your console works. Some things to note is that I am excluding a Personal Computer because it's functions are not just meant for video games. Anyway, there are three big tech giants with their consoles slammed right on them. The three are the following in no order</P>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
