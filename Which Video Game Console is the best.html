	<h1>What video game console is the best</hi>
<h3>Hello there, your probaly came onto this website looking for a answer. You probaly want a video game console or are looking at which one to get. My name is Jaiden, and here is an honest review on video game consoles.</h3>
<p>First, we have to rule what a gaming console is, and what it's functions are. A console is a computer designed for video games by connecting a screen and battery to it's ports. By doing so, you run the functions the console does and !SURPRISE!, your console works. Some things to note is that I am excluding a Personal Computer because it's functions are not just meant for video games. Anyway, there are three big tech giants with their consoles slammed right on them. The three are the following in no order</P>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Microsoft - Xbox 1</li>
	<li>Sony - Playstaion 4</li>

<div class="DS">
<p>The Nintendo 3DS and other models are really good hand held devices. Sadly, there no weare near as comparable as the other consoles. This is due to the fact that it is as big as some of the console controllers. It does come at a really cheap price of about $80. The price only makes it fairly obvious that  I'm Sorry if your disappointed, but it's the way it has to be.</p>

<h4>The Answer, the Nintendo Switch <img src="https://static-ca.ebgames.ca/images/products/729000/3max.jpg" alt= "HTML5 Icon" style="width:300px;hieght:128px;">
<p>Explanation - The Nintendo Switch can do things other consoles can't. In terms of it's cross play, it wins with crossplay on P.C., Xbox, Ps4, Mobile, Wii, Wii u, and the DS's. It's so easy to travel with, plus the touch screen on the go. It has two main accessories, which are the L.A.B.O. and the Amiibo. It's game catalog has the most exclusives, as well as it's fair share or triple A games. Sadly, you won't find any shooter games. Finally, it's subscription has the lowest price with some of the highest features.All in all, it is up to personal prefrance, like if the majority of your friends are on Xbox, then get an Xbox, but with the consideration of the price and the fact that the catalog of games and accessories of the switch are so good, the winner must be the switch.<p>
